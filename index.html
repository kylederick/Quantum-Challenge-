  <h1>Quantum Challenge</h1>
  <p>Just starting this new challenge to learn quantum computing and building a couple of cool shit starting off with fundamentals of physics (halliday and Resnick 9th edition) then moving into three volumes of Feynmans Lectures on Physics so I'll start studying and progressing out all the milestones including my software based projects in quantum and learning theory on this page lot of interesting stuff coming up</p>
  <p>Will do my build in public journey one day at a time my goal is to be consistent in studying and by the end of this 100 day challenge it is to be able to use and do some cool stuff with quantum frameworks then move onto some cool projects I've been having in my mind I'm also planning to learn pymunk and a couple of other python frameworks along the way
I'm also making an open source quantum roadmap after I'm done here's the link it's a wip will be done by the end of the challenge</p>
